* (github-actions[bot]) released this 2024-11-15 15:30:49 +0000 UTC*

== Description

== Notes

Fleet v0.11.1 improves several log and status messages. It reduces the amount of reconciles done by the controllers for resource changes.

This release adds k8s events for the GitRepo resource. Fleet will generate a k8s event that users can subscribe to, for the following events:

* Created - a new git cloning job was created
* GotNewCommit - a git repository has a new commit
* JobDeleted - a successful git cloning job is removed
* FailedValidatingSecret - a git cloning job cannot be created, because a required secret is missing
* FailedToApplyRestrictions - the GitRepo resource violates the GitRepoRestriction resource's rules
* FailedToCheckCommit - cannot get latest commit from the git server
* FailedToGetGitJob - cannot retrieve information from the git cloning job
* Failed - polling is disabled, triggered via webhook, but cannot get latest commit from the git server

There are a few known issues with this 0.11.1 release:

* Target customization for namespace labels and annotations cannot modify/remove labels when updating.
* In version 0.10, GitRepo resources provided a comprehensive list of all deployed resources across all clusters in their status. However, in version 0.11, this list has been modified to report resources only once until the feature is integrated into the Rancher UI. While this change addresses a UI freeze issue, it may result in potential inaccuracies in the list of resources and resource counts under some conditions.
